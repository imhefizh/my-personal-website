                        I&apos;m a youth who loves building clean, functional, and meaningful digital solutions. Whether it&apos;s a simple boarding house system or a full-stack web app, I enjoy turning real-life problems into smooth, tech-powered experiences.

                        Most of the time, you&apos;ll find me tweaking projects, solving bugs, or experimenting with small devices like the ESP32. I love learning by doingâ€”and yes, coffee helps a lot â˜•ðŸ˜„

                        While I take my code seriously, I always keep the vibes relaxed. I believe good ideas often come from casual conversations and curious minds.
